# Welcome to the C-linux-shell wiki!

A Unix shell is a command-line interpreter that provides a traditional user interface for the Unix
operating system and for Unix-like systems. The shell can run in two modes: interactive and batch.

## Interactive mode

start the shell program, which displays a prompt and the user of the shell types commands at the prompt. shell program executes each of these commands and terminates when the user enters the exit command at the prompt

## Batch mode

Start the shell by calling your shell program and specifying a batch file to execute the
commands included in it. This batch file contains the list of commands (on separate lines) that the
user wants to execute
